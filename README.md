# A tool for scrapping images from yandex

I wrote a really useful script for scrapping only original images from yandex

## Getting Started

You need a python >=3.6
Just clon my repo and run main.py with flags, where:

Number of images: -c
Folder to save: -f
Search request: -s

## Example:
```
python3 main.py -c 100 -f cats -s 'cat'
```
